Current Issues:
1.  Pressing search with no text while not focused on the search textbox
    effectively searches for the SEARCH_INPUT_HINT
2.  Consider adding a loading bar of some sort. Hiding search results, then
    when load is complete, show rows. 
3.  Change the header of the treeview for dark mode.
4.  Consider ensuring popups adhere to light and dark mode.

Fixing Implementations:
1.  Add a check on the search enter button: if has typed is false, and our
    text box equals the hint text, then we treat it as if the result is blank.
2. treeview.configure(displaycolumns=()), then add the columns in the parenthesis.
   Hiding the rows skips the render step, so rows load faster theoretically.

Final Touches:
1. Ensure program is runnable from main.
2. Remove unused imports.
3. Rewrite README with all new features and installation methods, etc.
4. Update requirements.txt.
5. Ensure classes are neat and methods are documented, typing in headers, ->, etc.
    Full javadoc-like comments are unnecessary.
6. Ensure unused methods outside of main are private.
