Final Touches:
** Add a "clear search box" check to exit search functionality.
1. Ensure program is runnable from main.
2. Remove unused imports.
3. Rewrite README with all new features and installation methods, etc.
4. Update requirements.txt.
5. Ensure classes are neat and methods are documented, typing in headers, ->, etc.
    Full javadoc-like comments are unnecessary.
6. Ensure unused methods outside of main are private.
