TODO:
*-------------
Current Issues:
 -> Pressing search with no text while not focused on the search textbox
 -> effectively searches for the SEARCH_INPUT_HINT
*-------------

When would we want to track if we've typed in a box?
When we go to clear the entry boxes and if we've actually typed, we do not clear.
This happens under the rare circumstance if the user types the hint into the box,
and upon clicking into it, it disappears.


* Consider ensuring popups adhere to light/dark mode.
*** Disable search functionality while data is populating.
* Ensure program is runnable from main
* Remove/Rename Old/New Classes
* Remove files unneeded
* Rewrite README for release
* Update requirements.txt

* Structurally:
* Ensure classes are neat
* Ensure all classes are separated by its own file
* Ensure all classes and methods are documented
    - this includes typing all variables and adding returns ->.
* Ensure un-needed methods are private
